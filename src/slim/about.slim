          | A UX product designer, residing in beautiful Stockholm, Sweden. I'm happily employed at <a href="https://commonground.se/" target="_blank" class="inline-link">Common Ground Design Studio</a> and I consult where I'm needed.<br />I am also an experienced front end designer. So I can 'code'.<br/> I could mention all the things you've read a thousand times before. Like how I create meaningful user-centric. How I can create pixel perfection as well as doing user-research. That's all true. It's true of most UX designers.<br/ > But you're not here for skills charts and generic taglines. You're here, presumably, to learn about me, as an indiviual. So let's get personal.
